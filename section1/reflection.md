    12345. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions?
    Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

    - _Over 20 minutes on a subject I don't understand, after research by myself,  
    I should ask without wasting too much time. I prefer to ask someone else and
    get an answer in 5-10, maybe 2 minutes,  instead of hesitating to ask a stupid question.
    Possibly for a moment, I will be someone who asks ridiculous questions, but I will
    save time by asking the determined questions at the right time.
    I don't think I asked the questions too soon. But I realized that I didn't ask
    in the right way. I have to ask short questions. My questions should be open-ended.
     I always need to ask questions that will make my job easier._


    2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
    - data types; numbers, strings of text (known as “strings”), and boolean truth values (known as “booleans”).
    - **Numbers** ; The numeric data type includes different kinds of numbers, such as
    negative numbers and decimals; large numbers are written without a comma.
    - **String** ; The Strings data type includes:
    letters and other characters. The string data type is enclosed in a pair of single
    or double quotes "letters and other characters" or "letters and other characters.
    " When numbers are enclosed in quotes, they are of type string data.
    - **Booleans** ; The Boolean data types execute one of two values: true or false.
     true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
    false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.
    - These characters use for the result; greater than > , greater than or equal >= ,
     less than < , less than or equal <= , equals == or === , not equal !=

    3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

    - console.log("Hello World!");

    4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a
     JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

    - For each line (**single line comments**), we use the two forward slash
    characters // before starting to indicate comments. To indicate comments
    (**multi-line comments**) over more than one line, we use the characters
    /* for before comments and */after comments. We can write slight hints;
    we specify what we should do while writing the code. But its primary purpose
    is to help others and show why, how we wrote this code in a standard code study
    for those who look and read my code. In short, it contains brief information
    about the code we wrote. Comments explain what my code does and help me ,
    if I come back to my code after several days or months.

    5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    - _Variables_ are items created during program execution and used to store data.
     When creating variables, their names and the data type they will hold are determined.
    This name will be used when a value is given to the variable or when you want to
    access the stored value of the variable. All variable names must be unique and
    descriptive names. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores,
    and dollar signs. Variable names can begin with letters, underscores, or dollar signs.
    Variable names are CASE-sensitive. (a and A are different variables) No spaces are
    left between variable names. JavaScript keywords cannot be used as variable names.
    (var, debugger, if, while…etc.) Let's say we have a box where we put some Lego pieces.
    And we want to make a new lego using the piece we want. Maybe a spider-headed
    person, perhaps a woman with flower arms, a man with a dog's paw. Let's say
    variable to the box where these legos pieces are, and the variable name is
    each lego piece chosen by the child; value is what he will use that piece as.
    Thus, it will be shown that lego's box is our variable where we store lego's pieces.
    And the child, whenever they want, pick any piece and give name/task.


    6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably
     used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

    - _I can give examples of many different applications amazon, chewy, Instagram, Petco.
    While taking an appointment from a groomer in Petco, possible used variables are name, age,
    gender, and neutered information about my pet. My account, password, and user name are necessary.
    When they filled the name and title while getting a groomer appointment, this was an example of
    a string-type data type. An example is the number data type when they ask for age. If the dog is
    infertile, I can give an example of the boolean data type with true and false answers._

    7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

    - **The concatenation** allows us to create a single value by joining two or more strings together.
    "Concatenate" is a programming term that String data type that is logged to console by adding new words and using variable value.

    8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

    - I've been thinking about an example when taking a covid test these days. After answering the necessary information in the question's name, the last name such as string data type, age such as number data type, and answering for true/false questions such as boolean data type,  I get a confirmation sentence with my information. I think the concatenation is used here.

    9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

    - My question is concatenation and interpolation. Maybe I missed the difference between them. While studying, the concatenation(join together) looked the same programming as interpolation. If I missed something between them, I would like to know. **Same result, different way!**
