## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It was hard to understand what you asked. By watching videos and asking to friends, I tried to do something. While searching , I have found different ways how to write my codes.But I am still spending more time until figure out the problems by myself.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
**Array list** is used in Netflix by showing movie types by developers.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
###### Array Methods are used for adding or removing something (one or more than one items of String,numbers or boolean data types) from Array.
##Unshift
This method helps us to add one or more than one item , in the beginning of array.
varName.**unshift();**

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without? loopu ne zaman array
**Loops** is used for iteration based on condition until the condition is evaluated false.
Array and loop are used together to sort many different types of data, iterate through indexes in that array, and add new information while repeating.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
While a kid is studying on numbers , I can show  how to write numbers between 1 and 10 ,
instead of writing all number between 1 to 10 .

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I searched and tried but I couldn't find answer for showing "i*=2" or divide / , instead of "i++"!!! how to show divide or times?
