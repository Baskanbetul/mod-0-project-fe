## Section 2 Reflection

  1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  One of my new spots is **S.M.A.R.T. goals** (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound). S.M.A.R.T. It's something I've never heard of before. Thanks to S.M.A.R.T Goals, I'll be able to work on easy tasks by breaking down large coding projects. It will also help me plan and strategize how to handle coding projects promptly. The value of SMART goals is that it focuses people on setting goals and prompt discussion of these goals with others.
  Learning to code has numerous benefits, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, processing, and systematic thinking skills. To improve with constant practice, constantly focusing, not giving up, asking for help at the right time without hesitation, being open to feedback and suggestions, always looking for a more efficient way to do something, helps you learn to code, and having a Growth Mindset. Learning to program can encourage growth-oriented behaviors such as goal setting, effective effort, and continually striving for improvement. In conclusion, programming and a growth mindset have a symbiotic relationship; Developing one can help improve the other. Developing one skill helps improve another.

  2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  I focused on practicing more for having experience, learning. While facing coding challenges, I don't give up and keep asking more questions. The most important is feedback for me. I try to get information or constructive feedback from others.
  Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals is a braw new Information that I don't try before. S.M.A.R.T. practicing tuning helps programmers plan and strategize how to handle coding projects on time. And I should learn by practicing setting my goals by setting in S.M.A.R.T.  to be a good programmer. Also, I need to focus on the process; I know that reflecting on the coding process is critical for advancing coding skills.

  3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  •••**At first**, I thought you wrote incompletely and incorrectly. But then, after asking myself and starting to research the problem by looking at other sections, I understood. Searching for the answer,  rather than the answers you gave, allowed me to think critically and find the right one by trying.

  4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  **Conditional statements** determine whether or not pieces of code can run. It is based on a concept of if/then/else; if a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different (or just skips the step).
  ### Different types of conditionals;
  •••_“If”_ statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
  •••_“Else”_ statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.
  •••_“Else if”_ statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.
  A daily life conditional; If I don't wake up early, I can't go to work on time.

  5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  _"else" and  "else if" (JavaScript keyword)_ can help us create multiple conditions.
  By using "else", I add multiple conditions to an "if " statement.  The code executes when the condition is true(value is true). And It is up to how to condition's evaluation.

  •••**For example:**

  •••_if ... else_;   if first condition (value) is true (evaluates to true), first code block executes, if it is false, second code block executes.

  •••if (condition1) {
  •••first code block() ;
  •••}
  •••else {
  •••second code block() ;
  •••}

  •••_else if_ ;

  •••if (condition1) {
  •••a block of code (executes if condition1 is true );
  •••} else if (condition2) {
  •••a block of code (executes if condition1 is false ;and condtion2 is true)
  •••} else if (condition3) {
  •••ablock of code (executes if condition1and condition2 are false and condtion3 is true);
  •••} else {
  •••a block of code (execute if none of conditions above are true );
  •••}

  6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  I'm rewriting the code by checking the Terminal. I check the color of the code before running the code in Terminal. Each Javascript keyword (variable, value, condition, datatypes) and a block of code has a color. Also, I compare the code block with other examples in exercises, books. As I write the code, I review other possibilities. I am comparing the variable name with the desired condition by asking myself questions. ( less than, greater than, etc. )

  7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  I have questions about the terms and examples I meet while reading the book (JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY: Interactive Front-End Web Development). They are different from the ones I use. But according to what I read, we will learn this concept in mode 1.
